# Running the Project
Follow the steps below if you wish to run this project on your personal machine:

Please note that the following instructions use VSCode as the IDE of choice.

Download this repository and decompress the zip file.

Import the decompressed folder into VSCode or your preferred IDE.

Open the VSCode terminal or your command prompt to install the necessary library:

Execute the command pip install pygame.

If the above command does not work, try substituting it with py -m pip. If neither of these options work, I recommend checking out this article: https://www.technewstoday.com/pip-install-not-working/

After completing the above steps, your environment should be set up and ready to execute the program. Simply navigate to the main.py file and click the run icon to start.
